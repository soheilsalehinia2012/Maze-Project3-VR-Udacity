VR Nanodegree Course 1 Project
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My name is Soheil Salehinia.
It took about one hour to complete this project.
I like that I build my first VR app.
The challenging part of this project was deploying the app to my android device.

Description:
Added my name to Hello World text. (By Soheil Salehinia)
Added 3 buttons, first for changing between day or night, second for using flash light and third for drop cubes from sky.
In third one number of cubes changed from 10 to 30.
